    <p class="lead fs-5 m-4">
      As a coder, we view the world as a collection of problems
      waiting for solutions.Through the lens of coding, we unlock new perspectives of the world around us. Each line of
      code is a brushstroke that paints the digital landscape, transforming abstract ideas into functional realities.
      From solving problems to automating tasks, coding allows us to shape the world with precision, creativity, and
      innovation. When we write code, we’re not just typing lines—we're building the future, one algorithm at a time.
    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-5 mx-4">
      With every algorithm we design and every function we create, we gain a deeper understanding of the systems that
      power our daily lives. Coding is the ultimate lens through which we can explore the complexities of the digital
      world, turning abstract concepts into tangible solutions. Whether it’s designing a user interface, building an
      app, or developing a website, coding gives us the tools to bring ideas to life in ways we never thought possible.
    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-5 mx-4">
      Through coding, we begin to see patterns where others see chaos, and solutions where others see problems. It’s not
      just about syntax or frameworks—it’s about thinking critically and innovatively to solve real-world challenges.
      Each bug we debug, each line we optimize, and each feature we implement brings us one step closer to a world where
      technology and human creativity merge seamlessly.
    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-5 mx-4">
      The beauty of coding lies in its simplicity and its complexity, its logic and its artistry. It’s a universal
      language that connects minds, across cultures and disciplines, to create something greater than the sum of its
      parts. In coding, we see not just what is, but what could be.
    </p>
    <p class="lead fs-5 mx-4">
      To code is to transform ideas into reality. It’s a process of continuous discovery, where each project uncovers
      new possibilities, challenges, and opportunities to learn. Just as a painter steps back to view their canvas, a
      coder steps back to see how their lines of code interact, forming a larger picture that can change lives. From
      small scripts that automate mundane tasks to complex systems that drive entire industries, coding empowers us to
      push the boundaries of what’s possible. It's a tool that not only shapes our digital world but also helps us shape
      how we perceive and engage with it.

    <h2>1. Front-End Development:</h2>
    <p class="lead fs-5 fw-lighter">
      Front-end development, often referred to as "client-side development,"
      involves the part of a website or web application that users interact
      with directly. This includes everything from the layout, design, and
      structure to the behavior of the website on the user’s browser.
      Front-end developers use three main technologies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          HTML is the backbone of any website, providing the basic structure
          and content. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images,
          links, and forms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          CSS is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements.
          It defines the design, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and
          positioning, as well as responsiveness for different screen sizes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>JavaScript:</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          JavaScript brings interactivity to a website. It is used to add
          dynamic behavior, such as form validation, animations, interactive
          maps, or real-time updates without reloading the page.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. Back-End Development:</h2>
    <p class="lead fs-5 fw-lighter">
      Back-end development refers to the server-side part of web development.
      It is responsible for managing the database, server, and application
      logic that supports the front-end of a website. Back-end developers
      focus on how data is stored, retrieved, and processed to serve the
      user’s request.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Server-Side Languages:</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          The back-end is typically built using programming languages such as:
          Node.js (JavaScript), Python (Django, Flask), Ruby (Rails), PHP,
          Java (Spring), and .NET are common back-end technologies.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h5>Databases:</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          A back-end application interacts with databases to store and manage
          data. There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query
          Language)and Non-relational databases like MongoDB and Firebase,
          which store data in more flexible, document-based formats.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>Web Servers:</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          Web servers handle HTTP requests and responses. Popular web servers
          include Apache and Nginx, which serve content from the server to the
          client.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</h5>
        <p class="fw-lighter">
          APIs allow the front-end and back-end of a web application to
          communicate with each other. They are often used to exchange data
          and trigger actions between systems, whether internal or external
          (e.g., third-party APIs like Google Maps or payment gateways).
        </p>
